# My Portfolio Homework

## Expectation

To create a web application from scratch! A portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs.


## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## My Task

WHEN a hiring manager loads my portofolio, then they are presented with my name, a photo, and links about me, my work and how to contact me.  
WHEN they click on one of my links in the navigation, THEN my UI scrolls to the corresponding secton
WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work, THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my applications
WHEN they are presented with my first application, THEN that application's image shall be larger in the size than the others
WHEN they click on the images of the application, THEN will be taken to that of deployed application
WHEN they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport
